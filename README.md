Unreal Engine is a 3D computer graphics game engine developed by Epic Games, first showcased in the 1998 first-person shooter video game Unreal.

Initially developed for PC first-person shooters, it has since been used in a variety of genres of games and has been adopted by other industries, most notably the film and television industry.

Unreal Engine enables you to create next-generation real-time 3D content and experiences with greater freedom, fidelity, and flexibility.
